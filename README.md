# BUDGET APP
This app was developed to assist with budgeting. It was based at a company I worked for.

## TECHNOLOGIES
This APP was developed with Expo CLI and these other technologies:

 - **React Native:** mobile development.
 - **NodeJS:**  back-end development.
 - **Express:** help building the backend.
 - **SQLite:** database access.
 - **Knex:** database creation and manipulation.


## WHY THIS PROJECT?
After realizing that one day we forgot to bring paper for notes, I realized that creating an app would be a good way to positively impact both the company and nature.

## HOW TO EXECUTE
With you have Expo CLI:
 - Open each of the folders in the terminal and run `npm install` or `yarn install`.

If you don't have Expo CLI: 

 - Follow the documentation for installation: [Installation - Expo Documentation](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/)
 -  Open each of the folders in the terminal and run `npm install`.

Before install:
 - Go to file `/src/service/api.js` inside `mobile`, copy and paste machine IP between "HTTP" and port (":3333").
 - Save the file.
 - Execute `npm start` or  `yarn start` in backend and mobile.
 - To access, write user : `ojairo` and pass: `ojairo`.
